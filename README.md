# SemOpinionS - Semantic Opinion Summarization

This repository contains all code for the SemOpinionS tool, a text summarization tool for opinionative texts, produced for obtaining my Master's Degree to be presented soon.

All information on how to run the tool and on each argument used, as well as input file formats, can be seen in the [Wiki page](https://github.com/Superar/SemOpinionS/wiki/Arguments) of this same repository.

Further information on the methods will be made available through future publications, which will be updated and linked here.
